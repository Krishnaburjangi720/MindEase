## 💡 The Problem
Students today face unprecedented levels of academic pressure, anxiety, and loneliness.
-   **Accessibility:** Professional therapy is often expensive or booked out.
-   **Stigma:** Many students fear judgment if they reach out to friends or family.
-   **Timing:** Crises often happen late at night when campus resources are closed.

## 🚀 The Solution: MindEase
MindEase bridges the gap between distress and professional help by providing:
1.  **24/7 Availability:** An AI companion that is always awake and ready to listen.
2.  **Anonymity:** No login or personal data required, encouraging honest expression.
3.  **Actionable Advice:** Instead of generic quotes, it generates specific, small-step recovery tips based on the student's situation.
